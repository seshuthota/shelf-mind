        for agent in self.character_agents.values():
            insight = agent.analyze_situation(store_data)
            insights.append(insight)
        return sorted(insights, key=lambda x: x.priority, reverse=True)
```

## Technical Implementation

### 🤖 **Character Agent Architecture**
Each character agent implements the same interface but with unique personality:

```python
class CharacterAgent:
    def __init__(self, character_name, expertise_area):
        self.character_name = character_name
        self.expertise_area = expertise_area
        self.personality_prompt = CharacterPrompts.get_character_prompt(character_name)
        
    def analyze_situation(self, store_data):
        # Character-specific analysis with personality voice
        return {
            'character': self.character_name,
            'expertise': self.expertise_area,
            'priority': self.calculate_priority(store_data),
            'insight': self.generate_character_insight(store_data),
            'reasoning': self.get_character_reasoning(store_data)
        }
```

### 🎪 **Hybrid Bridge System**
Maintains single-agent functionality while adding character ensemble:

```python
class HybridMultiAgentBridge:
    def __init__(self, scrooge_agent, multi_agent_engine):
        self.scrooge_agent = scrooge_agent  # Original master agent
        self.multi_agent_engine = multi_agent_engine  # Character ensemble
        
    def get_daily_decision(self, store_data):
        # Scrooge makes the actual decisions
        scrooge_decision = self.scrooge_agent.make_daily_decision(store_data)
        
        # Characters provide insights and analysis
        character_insights = self.multi_agent_engine.get_character_insights(store_data)
        
        return {
            'decision': scrooge_decision,
            'character_insights': character_insights
        }
