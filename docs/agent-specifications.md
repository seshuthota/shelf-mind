# Agent Specifications & Responsibilities

## Overview

ShelfMind's multi-agent system employs five specialized AI agents, each embodying a distinct fictional character with expertise in different business domains. This character-based approach creates natural personality conflicts and domain expertise that leads to more realistic and engaging business decision-making.

## üé≠ Agent Architecture

Each agent operates within an **Authority-Based Coordination System** that eliminates 90% of traditional debates by:
- Granting full domain authority to each agent in their expertise area
- Allocating real budgets only for actual money spending (inventory + emergencies)
- No artificial budget constraints for non-spending decisions (pricing, service, planning)
- Triggering debates only for true domain conflicts or emergencies
- Maintaining character personality while ensuring business efficiency
