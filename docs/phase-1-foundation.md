## ✅ Phase 1A: Ultra-Basic Store - **COMPLETED**
**Goal**: Get core LLM decision-making loop working

### 1A.1 Minimal Store Setup ✅
- **Product catalog**: 5 items only (Coke, Chips, Candy, Water, Gum)
  - Fixed attributes: cost $1, sell $2, no spoilage, infinite shelf space
- **Inventory system**: Simple stock counter (no deliveries, just "order more")
- **Financial tracking**: Just cash balance and daily profit
- **Time system**: Simple day counter

### 1A.2 Basic LLM Agent ✅
- **Daily decisions**: How many of each product to order?
- **Simple tools**: `check_inventory()`, `place_order(product, quantity)`, `check_cash()`
- **Memory**: Remember yesterday's sales and decisions
- **Safety**: Can't spend more than available cash
- **Character**: Enhanced with Scrooge personality for better decision-making

### 1A.3 Ultra-Simple Customers ✅
- **One customer type**: Random buyer who purchases 1-3 random items per day
- **Fixed demand**: 10-20 customers per day, no price sensitivity
- **Simple logic**: Buy if item in stock, leave if not

### 1A.4 Basic Dashboard ✅
- **Simple display**: Inventory levels, cash, daily sales
- **LLM chat**: Ask the agent why it made decisions
- **Manual controls**: Fast-forward days, reset simulation
