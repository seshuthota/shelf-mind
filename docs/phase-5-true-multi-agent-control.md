# Phase 5: True Multi-Agent Control & Enhanced Intelligence
*Revolutionary Transition from Character Analysis to Character Command*

## Overview

Phase 5 represents the **critical transition** from character-driven analysis to **true character-controlled business operations**. Based on comprehensive testing feedback, this phase addresses the fundamental gap between character intelligence and actual business control, transforming our character ensemble from advisors into the **primary decision-makers** of the business.
