## Core Concept: **AI Convenience Store Manager**

**What the LLM manages:**
- Daily inventory ordering decisions  
- Dynamic pricing and competitive warfare
- Cash flow and budget management
- Customer service interactions
- Supplier relationship management
- Performance optimization

**Simulated Environment:**
- **Customers**: Rule-based agents with different preferences, budgets, price sensitivity
- **Suppliers**: Automated vendors with fluctuating prices and availability
- **Market events**: Random scenarios (weather affecting demand, competitor actions)
- **Store operations**: Realistic constraints (shelf space, spoilage, delivery times)
- **üî• ULTRA-AGGRESSIVE COMPETITOR**: AI-driven competitor with psychological warfare capabilities

**Your Role:**
- **Market interference**: "Competitor just opened across the street"
- **Difficult scenarios**: "Health inspector visit requires expensive upgrades"  
- **Customer complaints**: Act as angry customer demanding refunds
- **Strategic guidance**: Provide market insights or challenge decisions
- **Emergency situations**: "Supplier just went bankrupt"

- **Product catalog**: 5 items only (Coke, Chips, Candy, Water, Gum)
  - Fixed attributes: cost $1, sell $2, no spoilage, infinite shelf space
- **Inventory system**: Simple stock counter (no deliveries, just "order more")
- **Financial tracking**: Just cash balance and daily profit
- **Time system**: Simple day counter

### 1A.2 Basic LLM Agent ‚úÖ
