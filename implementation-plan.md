# AI Store Manager - Implementation Plan
*Inspired by Anthropic's Project Vend*

## üéØ **CURRENT STATUS**: Phase 1C Customer Segmentation - COMPLETE & LEGENDARY ‚úÖ
**Next Target**: Phase 1D (Supplier Complexity) or Anti-Turtling Enhancement

**‚úÖ LATEST EPIC ACHIEVEMENT**: Customer Segmentation with Multi-Dimensional Warfare - EXTRAORDINARY SUCCESS!

## Overview
Build an AI agent that autonomously manages a simulated convenience store with real business complexity but simplified execution. The agent handles inventory decisions, pricing, promotions, and customer interactions while you provide feedback and market interference as the system runs.

---

## Core Concept: **AI Convenience Store Manager**

**What the LLM manages:**
- Daily inventory ordering decisions  
- Dynamic pricing and competitive warfare
- Cash flow and budget management
- Customer service interactions
- Supplier relationship management
- Performance optimization

**Simulated Environment:**
- **Customers**: Rule-based agents with different preferences, budgets, price sensitivity
- **Suppliers**: Automated vendors with fluctuating prices and availability
- **Market events**: Random scenarios (weather affecting demand, competitor actions)
- **Store operations**: Realistic constraints (shelf space, spoilage, delivery times)
- **üî• ULTRA-AGGRESSIVE COMPETITOR**: AI-driven competitor with psychological warfare capabilities

**Your Role:**
- **Market interference**: "Competitor just opened across the street"
- **Difficult scenarios**: "Health inspector visit requires expensive upgrades"  
- **Customer complaints**: Act as angry customer demanding refunds
- **Strategic guidance**: Provide market insights or challenge decisions
- **Emergency situations**: "Supplier just went bankrupt"

---

## ‚úÖ Phase 1A: Ultra-Basic Store - **COMPLETED**
**Goal**: Get core LLM decision-making loop working

### 1A.1 Minimal Store Setup ‚úÖ
- **Product catalog**: 5 items only (Coke, Chips, Candy, Water, Gum)
  - Fixed attributes: cost $1, sell $2, no spoilage, infinite shelf space
- **Inventory system**: Simple stock counter (no deliveries, just "order more")
- **Financial tracking**: Just cash balance and daily profit
- **Time system**: Simple day counter

### 1A.2 Basic LLM Agent ‚úÖ
- **Daily decisions**: How many of each product to order?
- **Simple tools**: `check_inventory()`, `place_order(product, quantity)`, `check_cash()`
- **Memory**: Remember yesterday's sales and decisions
- **Safety**: Can't spend more than available cash
- **Character**: Enhanced with Scrooge personality for better decision-making

### 1A.3 Ultra-Simple Customers ‚úÖ
- **One customer type**: Random buyer who purchases 1-3 random items per day
- **Fixed demand**: 10-20 customers per day, no price sensitivity
- **Simple logic**: Buy if item in stock, leave if not

### 1A.4 Basic Dashboard ‚úÖ
- **Simple display**: Inventory levels, cash, daily sales
