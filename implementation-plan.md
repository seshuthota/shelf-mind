# AI Store Manager - Implementation Plan
*Inspired by Anthropic's Project Vend*

## 🎯 **CURRENT STATUS**: Dynamic Competitor Enhancement - COMPLETE & EXCEEDED ✅
**Next Target**: Phase 1C (Customer Types) or Advanced Market Dynamics

**✅ LATEST MEGA-ACHIEVEMENT**: Ultra-Aggressive Dynamic Competitor with Psychological Warfare - COMPLETE!

## Overview
Build an AI agent that autonomously manages a simulated convenience store with real business complexity but simplified execution. The agent handles inventory decisions, pricing, promotions, and customer interactions while you provide feedback and market interference as the system runs.

## Core Concept: **AI Convenience Store Manager**

**What the LLM manages:**
- Daily inventory ordering decisions  
- Dynamic pricing and competitive warfare
- Cash flow and budget management
- Customer service interactions
- Supplier relationship management
- Performance optimization

**Simulated Environment:**
- **Customers**: Rule-based agents with different preferences, budgets, price sensitivity
- **Suppliers**: Automated vendors with fluctuating prices and availability
- **Market events**: Random scenarios (weather affecting demand, competitor actions)
- **Store operations**: Realistic constraints (shelf space, spoilage, delivery times)
- **🔥 ULTRA-AGGRESSIVE COMPETITOR**: AI-driven competitor with psychological warfare capabilities

**Your Role:**
- **Market interference**: "Competitor just opened across the street"
- **Difficult scenarios**: "Health inspector visit requires expensive upgrades"  
- **Customer complaints**: Act as angry customer demanding refunds
- **Strategic guidance**: Provide market insights or challenge decisions
- **Emergency situations**: "Supplier just went bankrupt"

## ✅ Phase 1A: Ultra-Basic Store - **COMPLETED**
**Goal**: Get core LLM decision-making loop working

### 1A.1 Minimal Store Setup ✅
- **Product catalog**: 5 items only (Coke, Chips, Candy, Water, Gum)
  - Fixed attributes: cost $1, sell $2, no spoilage, infinite shelf space
- **Inventory system**: Simple stock counter (no deliveries, just "order more")
- **Financial tracking**: Just cash balance and daily profit
- **Time system**: Simple day counter

### 1A.2 Basic LLM Agent ✅
- **Daily decisions**: How many of each product to order?
- **Simple tools**: `check_inventory()`, `place_order(product, quantity)`, `check_cash()`
- **Memory**: Remember yesterday's sales and decisions
- **Safety**: Can't spend more than available cash
- **Character**: Enhanced with Scrooge personality for better decision-making

### 1A.3 Ultra-Simple Customers ✅
- **One customer type**: Random buyer who purchases 1-3 random items per day
- **Fixed demand**: 10-20 customers per day, no price sensitivity
- **Simple logic**: Buy if item in stock, leave if not

### 1A.4 Basic Dashboard ✅
- **Simple display**: Inventory levels, cash, daily sales
- **LLM chat**: Ask the agent why it made decisions
- **Manual controls**: Fast-forward days, reset simulation

**✅ DELIVERED**: LLM successfully avoids stockouts and makes profit for 7+ days

---

## ✅ Phase 1B: Add Price Sensitivity - **COMPLETED**
**Goal**: LLM learns basic supply/demand dynamics

### 1B.1 Pricing Decisions ✅

## 🚀 **NEXT STEPS RECOMMENDATION**

With the **Dynamic Competitor Enhancement MASSIVELY EXCEEDED**, we have two clear paths:

### Option A: Phase 1C - Customer Types 👥
**Why Now**: The competitive system is so sophisticated that adding customer segmentation will create incredible strategic depth. Imagine Scrooge having to balance:
- **Price-sensitive customers** vs **Brand-loyal customers**
- **Competitor psychological warfare** vs **Customer segment optimization**
- **Multi-layered strategic decisions** with both competitive and customer intelligence

### Option B: Advanced Market Events 🌪️
**Alternative**: Since our competitor AI is so advanced, we could add **random market events** that both you AND the competitor have to react to:
- **Supply shortages** affecting both stores
- **Economic downturns** changing customer behavior  
- **Seasonal demand spikes** creating inventory wars
- **Regulatory changes** forcing strategy shifts

### 💡 **RECOMMENDATION: Phase 1C (Customer Types)**
The ultra-aggressive competitor system is so sophisticated that adding customer segmentation will create **unprecedented strategic complexity**. Scrooge will need to:
- Price differently for different customer segments
- Counter competitor moves while optimizing for customer types
- Handle psychological warfare while managing customer loyalty
- Balance volume vs. margin across multiple customer behavioral patterns

**This will test the absolute limits of LLM strategic decision-making!** 🎯
