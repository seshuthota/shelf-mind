## 💬 **Chat with Scrooge**

```bash
You: Why did you cut prices so aggressively?
🤖 Scrooge: Bah! The competitor just launched an AGGRESSIVE CUT on Chips from 
            $1.95 to $1.87! At price war intensity 8/10, I deployed maximum 
            warfare tactics - cut to $1.72 to steal their customers! 
            War demands decisive action, not timid half-measures!

You: How's business performance?
🤖 Scrooge: Excellent question! Yesterday we achieved $22.50 profit with 25 units sold.
            We're winning 4 out of 5 price wars, maintaining 🟢 STRONG performance 
            despite 🔥 MAXIMUM WAR conditions. My competitive intelligence shows 
            we're dominating the market through strategic aggression!
